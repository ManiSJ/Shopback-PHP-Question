Question 1

Joel and Henry are playing a game. They have N balls numbered from 0 to N−1.Henry asks Joel to reverse the position of the balls, i.e., to change the order from say, 0,1,2,3 to 3,2,1,0. He further asks Joel to reverse the position of the balls N times, each time starting from one position further to the right, till he reaches the last ball. So, Joel has to reverse the positions of the ball starting from 0th position, then from 1st position, then from 2nd position and so on. At the end of the game, Henry will ask Joel the final position of any ball numbered K. Joel will win the game, if he can answer. Help Joel.Write in PHP.Input Format. The first line contains an integer T, i.e., the number of the test cases. The next T lines will contain two integers N and K.Output Format. Print the final index in array.

EXPLANATION

For first test case, The rotation will be like this: 

0 1 2 -> 2 1 0 -> 2 0 1 -> 2 0 1

So, Index of 1 will be 2.
